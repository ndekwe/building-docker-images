This repository holds files which have been used to describe three ways of building Docker images.

# The 3 ways are the following:
# 1. Building Docker image with a normal build

![Normal Build] images/normal-docker-build.png

2. Building Docker image from a jar file
3. Building Docker image with multi-stages build

# Usage
- For normal build check the Dockerfile under "building-docker-images/normal-build/"
- For multi-stages build check files under "building-docker-images/multi-stage-build/"
- Use files under "building-docker-images/buildFromPackage/" to build from a jar file
